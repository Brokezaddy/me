                                There’s no better substitute for water, but let’s face it,
                                 it’s tasteless. You can tantalize your taste buds while 
                                hydrating using coconut water as it contains 95% water content,
                                 yet it tastes way better than plain water.

                                Moreover, coconut water is a natural product that does not 
                                contain chemicals like sports drinks. You can always drink 
                                coconut water anytime, even on an empty stomach.

                                 1-2 times per day may aid in strengthening your immunity 
                                while keeping you properly hydrated. Because coconut water is
                                     highly hydrating, it may help move nutrients to organs.
                                Coconut water also contains lauric acid, which may help 
                                remove bacteria from your body, possibly eliminate intestinal
                                 parasites and potentially harmful microbes, and may help fight 
                                viruses that cause colds.

                                Coconut water is an excellent addition to a dietary

                                 has more calories than regular water and far fewer 
                                calories than soft drinks, coconut water has far more 
                                nutrition than soft drinks, making coconut water a 
                                better choice when reducing calories.
